Development Roadmap
*******************

OpenConcept is still very much alpha and is basically the product of one conference paper and a few months of work by one person.

Known issues to be addressed include:
    - No distinction right now between calibrated, equivalent, indicated airspeeds (compressibility effects) in the standard atmosphere
    - Spotty automated testing coverage
    - Spotty documentation coverage
    - Limited validation of the takeoff performance code (it is hard to find actual CLmax and drag polar data!)

Future ideas include:
    - Unifying the ODE integration math with NASA's Dymos toolkit

Costs
*****

OpenConcept's existing cost model is rather rudimentary and computes operating costs for a turboprop.
The component is called ``TurbopropOperatingCost``.
Unfortunately, there are not example aircraft that use this model, but the source code is relatively readable to figure out what inputs and outputs are needed.
Other cost models may be added in the future.

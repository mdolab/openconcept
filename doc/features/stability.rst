Tail volume coefficients
========================

In conceptual aircraft design, required horizontal and vertical tail areas of conventional configurations can be approximated using tail volume coefficients.
This method considers the wing area, wing mean aerodynamic chord, and distance between the wing's quarter mean aerodynamic chord and tail's quarter mean aerodynamic chord.
``HStabVolumeCoefficientSizing`` and ``VStabVolumeCoefficientSizing`` use tail volume coefficient relationships from :footcite:t:`raymer2006aircraft` to predict horizontal and vertical tail reference areas, respectively.

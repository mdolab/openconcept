OpenConcept
===========

OpenConcept is a toolkit for the conceptual design of aircraft.
It is open source (GitHub: https://github.com/mdolab/openconcept) and MIT licensed.
OpenConcept was developed in order to model and optimize aircraft with electric propulsion at low computational cost.
The tools are built on top of NASA Glenn's `OpenMDAO <http://openmdao.org/>`__ framework, which in turn is written in Python.

OpenConcept is capable of modeling a wide range of propulsion systems, including detailed thermal management systems.
The following figure (from `this paper <https://doi.org/10.3390/aerospace9050243>`__) shows one such system that is modeled in the ``N3_HybridSingleAisle_Refrig.py`` example.

The following charts show more than 250 individually optimized hybrid-electric light twin aircraft (similar to a King Air C90GT).
Optimizing hundreds of configurations can be done in a couple of hours on a standard laptop computer.

The reason for OpenConcept's efficiency is the analytic derivatives built into each analysis routine and component.
Accurate, efficient derivatives enable the use of Newton nonlinear equation solutions and gradient-based optimization at low computational cost.

---------------
Getting Started
---------------
OpenConcept can be pip installed directly from PyPI with ``pip install openconcept``.

To run the examples or edit the source code:

#. Clone the repo to disk (``git clone https://github.com/mdolab/openconcept``)
#. Navigate to the root ``openconcept`` folder
#. Run ``pip install -e .`` to install the package (the ``-e`` can be omitted if not editing the source)

Get started by following the tutorials to learn the most important parts of OpenConcept.
The features section of the documentation describes most of the components and system models available in OpenConcept.

Dependencies
------------

.. Remember to change in the readme too!

This toolkit requires the use of `OpenMDAO <https://openmdao.org>`__ 3.10.0 or later due to backward-incompatible changes.
OpenMDAO requires a recent NumPy and SciPy.
Python 3.8, 3.9, or 3.10 are recommended since they are the versions with which the code is tested, but newer Python versions will likely work as well.
